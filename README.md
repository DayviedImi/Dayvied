# Hi, I'm Korole David 👋

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** passionate about building functional, user-centered applications across both **web** and **mobile** platforms. From pixel-perfect frontend experiences to scalable backend systems, I build solutions that deliver value.

I also have a growing passion for **Artificial Intelligence** and enjoy building AI-powered tools that solve real-world problems.

In addition, I have strong interest and hands-on experience in **DevOps** — managing deployments, CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and automation to keep projects running smoothly in production.
